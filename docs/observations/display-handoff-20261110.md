# Display handoff qualification after genuine userspace service startup

Handset photo 1794279588945.jpg on run 42742941670 records launchd plus logd,
UserEventAgent, runningboardd, configd, mediaserverd, powerd and backboardd.
Volatile Data completed 679 writes and 1944 reads with zero transport failures.
The 600-second stop was an explicitly requested diagnostic panic. These facts
qualify userspace process creation and volatile I/O, not graphical startup.

The existing board selects no GopFramebuffer archive. Its inherited original
IOMobileGraphicsFamily and IOSurface classes are present in the OS profile, but
published display instances have not been observed. The reserved physical
framebuffer range is not proof of current GOP geometry/format/ownership.

Reviewed GopFramebuffer cf3b42979a9c44219e7bb149543e6fc3388b58ed and sheng recipe
516a780473a2ac59c8b438e132bb60204dda9e22. The recipe bundles SM8550 board power,
touch, audio and GPU probes. It must not be selected unchanged for SM8250.
NativeLegacyDisplay requires an audited original 21H461 private ABI plus board
hooks, IOSurface descriptors, publication and scanout preparation. NativeGOPPresenter
alone is not the original iOS compositor's display service.

Add an opt-in read-only observer to the existing watch. With
lmipro-data-watch=600 and lmipro-display-watch=1 it samples PE_current_console
and currently published IOMobileFramebuffer, IOMobileFramebufferLegacy,
IOSurfaceRoot and NativeGOPPresenter instances, then explicitly stops for a photo.
No service waits, service creation, mappings, display writes, DPU/DSI registers,
framebuffer ownership transfer, storage changes or error substitutions occur.
All original watch details remain available when lmipro-display-watch is absent.

PE_Video and IOService API checked against xnu-10063.141.1 pexpert/pexpert/pexpert.h,
pexpert/arm/pe_init.c and iokit/IOKit/IOService.h. The arithmetic layout status
does not qualify actual memory mapping or pixel format. Registry -1 is allocation
failure, -2 is an invalidated sample, and 33 is a capped count, never absence.

Next: capture actual geometry and published services from this new artifact,
then implement only the board display bridge justified by those measurements.
Source/host checks and a successful build do not establish handset display output.
